# cpp-algorithms
The repository contains my classes of algorithms written in C++

I have created some classes and their tests for algorithms. It uses:
- OOP, pointers, templates, timers, math, io manipulation
There are tests with ExObj classes that we use to calculate execution times in the project.

Projects were created in Code Blocks IDE and written using the g++ compiler standarded in v. ISO C++ 17.
